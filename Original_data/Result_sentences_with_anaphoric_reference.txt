./Mol_Cancer/Mol_Cancer-5-_-1762019.nxml.sentences:50:This result is particularly intriguing because HT1080 cells are among the most invasive tumor cell lines in both in vivo and in vitro settings [ 41 , 42 ] , suggesting a role for S1P responsiveness in highly invasive tumor cells .

./BMC_Evol_Biol/BMC_Evol_Biol-6-_-1513400.nxml.sentences-172-The study of Lamb and Irish further determined that the euAP3 motif is capable of conferring AP3-specific function to PI .
./BMC_Evol_Biol/BMC_Evol_Biol-6-_-1513400.nxml.sentences:173:This result is particularly intriguing since it suggests that dimers between the endogenous PI and chimeric PIcAP3 proteins were stabilized when one of the PI proteins possessed a euAP3 motif .

./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-5-2-1796938.nxml.sentences-20-But they were surprised to discover that this was not the case for the core clock gene mPer2 : rhythmic expression of mPer2 transcript and protein levels continued even in the absence of BMAL1 activity .
./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-5-2-1796938.nxml.sentences:21:This result is particularly noteworthy because in brain tissue from transgenic mice lacking Bmal1 , mPer2 transcripts in SCN neurons are barely noticeable during the course of a day .

./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-4-12-1750955.nxml.sentences-125-Intriguingly , cell survival under stringent UPR conditions is not dependent on vacuolar proteases : a vps4? pep4? strain showed significant growth even on 1-mg / ml tunicamycin plates ( Figure 8 , right panel , bottom row ) .
./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-4-12-1750955.nxml.sentences:126:This result is particularly remarkable as this strain is already growth impaired even under normal growth conditions ( Figure 8 , left panel , bottom row ) .

./PLoS_Comput_Biol/PLoS_Comput_Biol-5-4-2658886.nxml.sentences:284:This result is particularly striking if one compares the number of parameters fitted in the ICA model compared to the SSD case : After whitening , the optimization in ICA is done over the manifold of orthogonal matrices which has free parameters ( where denotes the number of dimensions without the DC components ) .

./Arthritis_Res/Arthritis_Res-3-4-128901.nxml.sentences-70-The work of N Busso and colleagues ( Lausanne and Geneva , Switzerland ; P23 ) described the surprising finding that mice deficient in leptin and its receptor are significantly less sensitive to collagen-induced arthritis than are wild type animals , as assessed by histology , lymphocyte proliferation assays , and technetium-99 scanning of joints .
./Arthritis_Res/Arthritis_Res-3-4-128901.nxml.sentences:71:This result is perhaps less surprising when one considers that leptin and its receptor are homologous to the respective cytokine / receptor pairs IL-6 and IL-11 .

./BMC_Cancer/BMC_Cancer-8-_-2576333.nxml.sentences-138-Overall DLC1 , the most well characterised tumour suppressor candidate in 8p22 , was only affected in a single cell line by a copy number decrease that included two other genes .
./BMC_Cancer/BMC_Cancer-8-_-2576333.nxml.sentences:139:This result is perhaps not surprising as it is known that DLC1 expression does not correlate with copy number [ 39 ] and , in several tumour types , down-regulation is caused by promoter methylation [ 40 ] .

./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-6-5-2430900.nxml.sentences:145:This result is perhaps not surprising as SPO11 sequences from diverged species are poorly conserved outside of the core catalytic residues [ 36 ] ( Figure S1 ) .
--
./BMC_Microbiol/BMC_Microbiol-9-_-2688506.nxml.sentences-77-However , the attempts to knockout either ech or dhfr-ts genes in T. cruzi using this approach were unsuccessful , presumably because the 78 nucleotide-gene-specific regions used in our constructs were insufficient for homologous recombination in T. cruzi .
./BMC_Microbiol/BMC_Microbiol-9-_-2688506.nxml.sentences:78:This result is perhaps not surprising as studies in Leishmania [ 32 ] demonstrated that at least 150 nucleotides are needed to guide homologous recombination .

./Algorithms_Mol_Biol/Algorithms_Mol_Biol-3-_-2543012.nxml.sentences:230:This result is plausible because the 3'-bias due to incomplete amplification of full-length transcripts applies per definition only to specific hybridization : Non-specific transcripts are not-specified with respect to their position relative to the 3'-end and thus they on the average hybridize equally to all probes regardless of their relative position .

./BMC_Bioinformatics/BMC_Bioinformatics-7-Suppl_2-1683562.nxml.sentences-127-It can be seen in Figrue 9 that the molecules with GC pairs more than 1 base-pair distant group vary similarly , the one molecule with no extra GC also separates with its own characteristic curve .
./BMC_Bioinformatics/BMC_Bioinformatics-7-Suppl_2-1683562.nxml.sentences:128:This result is precisely consistent ( Figure 9 ) with the increased reactivity of CA-3 , and with weaker variants in CA-2 and CA-4 , exactly as found experimentally in [ 27 , 28 ] - where it is observed that when the position of the dinucleotide pair CA / TG is altered slightly by mutation or in a synthetic substrate , the site of 3'-end processing and DNA joining , albeit weakened , moves correspondingly .

./Mol_Syst_Biol/Mol_Syst_Biol-3-_-1911197.nxml.sentences-270-However , our analysis shows a greater dependence on the maintenance parameters calculated for these conditions .
./Mol_Syst_Biol/Mol_Syst_Biol-3-_-1911197.nxml.sentences:271:This result is primarily due to our testing of a broader maintenance value range ( ±50 % of the calculated values as opposed to 20 % by Varma and Palsson ( 1995 ) ) .
--
./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-6-4-2689684.nxml.sentences-52-We detected ten times as many transcripts showing strain-condition interaction as has been previously reported for gene expression in yeast [ 22 ] .
./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-6-4-2689684.nxml.sentences:53:This result is primarily due to the number of replicates we performed ( six ) ; an analysis with two replicates detected a number of interactions similar to the previous report .

./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-6-7-2486311.nxml.sentences-134-Moreover , none of the correlations were significant when the individual physical similarity matrices resulting from each of the 20 Gabor filters were correlated one-by-one with neural similarities ( correlations ranging from 0.12 to 0.17 , none significant across participants ) .
./PLoS_Biol/PLoS_Biol-6-7-2486311.nxml.sentences:135:This result is probably due to the fact that the images were presented with a random jitter of ~2 degrees during scanning , which likely resulted in sufficiently nonoverlapping activations in retinotopic cortex to disrupt the neural similarity estimates in this region , and therefore also any correlation between neural and physical similarities .

./BMC_Bioinformatics/BMC_Bioinformatics-7-_-1564420.nxml.sentences-108-Again , we can only provide an impressionistic explanation .
./BMC_Bioinformatics/BMC_Bioinformatics-7-_-1564420.nxml.sentences:109:This result is probably due to the tendency for disorder names to be easier to identify than gene names .
--
./BMC_Evol_Biol/BMC_Evol_Biol-7-_-1847442.nxml.sentences-114-The data also suggest an association with polymorphic inversions as some clustering of genes within inverted chromosomal sections was detected .
./BMC_Evol_Biol/BMC_Evol_Biol-7-_-1847442.nxml.sentences:115:This result is probably not surprising in view of the rapidly evolved latitudinal clines in inversion frequencies after the introduction of the species into the New World [ 12 ] , as well as the quick response of inversion polymorphism to laboratory temperature [ 16 ] .

./BMC_Genomics/BMC_Genomics-8-_-1853087.nxml.sentences:175:This result is probably related to the negative relationship between the hybridization value and the coefficient of variation previously discussed .

--
./BMC_Bioinformatics/BMC_Bioinformatics-5-_-528726.nxml.sentences-176-As the probes aligned to multiple regions in the genome are eliminated and the probes that share larger segments are selected , the expression values become more consistent .
./BMC_Bioinformatics/BMC_Bioinformatics-5-_-528726.nxml.sentences:177:This result is promising because it does not use data-dependent information such as the empirical correlation for each gene between different versions of arrays , which can only be obtained through special datasets such as ours .

./BMC_Genomics/BMC_Genomics-7-_-1560386.nxml.sentences-139-While none of the interaction datasets change significantly with this process excluded , both gene expression datasets show substantial decay in their precision-recall characteristics , suggesting they are generally less reliable at predicting functional relationships over a broad range of processes .

./BMC_Evol_Biol/BMC_Evol_Biol-7-_-1891288.nxml.sentences-132-Since hybridogenetic populations are better protected against the accumulation and fixation of deleterious mutations than asexual populations , and at the same time , are less affected by the negative impacts of a higher deleterious mutation rates in males , hybridogenetically reproducing organisms perform better than asexual and sexual organisms at reduced population sizes under quadratic and truncation selection if a > 2 .
