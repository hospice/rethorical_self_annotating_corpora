Based upon these results we conclude that the matching pursuit algorithm provides a unified parametrization of EEG  applicable in a variety of experimental and clinical setups .,conclusion
The argument that globalization is beneficial in terms of population health [ 4 ] often starts from an equation of globalization with trade liberalization  and invokes comparative studies on national economies carried out under the auspices of the World Bank [ 5-7 ] which concluded that during the 1980s and 1990s  the economies of " globalizers " grew faster than " non-globalizers  " thereby expanding the resources at their disposal to provide health services and improve access to other SDH  notably through reduction of extreme poverty .,conclusion

We have shown that among giraffe subspecific groupings  including those that are adjacent to one another  there is an almost complete lack of gene flow  suggesting that these groups are reproductively isolated and thus constitute separate lineages .,conclusion
Given that changes in the activity of these gene networks are not observed when respiration is inhibited well before ( 3 generations ) the aerobic-to-anaerobic transition  we hypothesize these networks may respond to the acute decrease in energy status that accompanies respiratory inhibition as it is clear they do not respond directly to the change in oxygen availability .,conclusion

In Figure 2A  the following two observations are noteworthy for both acidic and neutral pH : first  the flatness of the normalized intensity in the x = 1-0.3 range ( which reflects mainly short-range intra-subunit interaction )  compared with HA2 FP [ 16 ] ( where x denotes the fraction of labeled peptide )  suggests a very tight TMD association ; second  in the low x ( < 0.3 ) regime ( which emphasizes long-range inter-subunit interaction ) a much smaller increase in the normalized intensity than the case of FP also corroborates the idea of tight self-binding for HA2 TMD molecules .,conclusion
Instead  it appears most likely that CNTF receptor signaling by the MNs themselves plays a role in adult MN survival .,conclusion
Thus  the in vitro derived BMP2+ cells exhibit more mesodermal characteristics .,conclusion
Therefore  while rcsC mutations disrupt the RcsF?RcsC?RcsD?RcsB phosphorelay cascade  the phosphorylation of RcsB can not be fully reversed in the absence of RcsC phosphatase activity  as observed by the reduced flhDC-lacZ expression and motility exhibited by rcsC and rcsD mutants ( Figure 4 ) .,conclusion
Our current results obtained with the PPR analysis suggest that glutamate synaptic transmission is enhanced through a presynaptic mechanism in NRM secondary cells from morphine-tolerant rats .,conclusion
Most embryonic enhancers of Cx / Tc-Scr are predicted to lie between the mxpDch-3 and ptlD60 breakpoints because the mxpDch-3 allele appears to lack all Cx / Tc-Scr function  while ptlD60 has almost normal embryonic Cx / Tc-Scr function .,conclusion
Our experiments thus show that a substantial proportion of recently emerged ECB females can and do mate at a very local scale before engaging in any long-range dispersal .,conclusion
These results strongly suggested that all vertebrate ß-defensins are evolved from a single gene .,conclusion
However  the finding that the K206R mutation leaves the anti-estrogen / AF-independent pathway intact brings acetylation as a mechanism into doubt .,conclusion
Nevertheless  our data together with previous reports point to functions for the FET family in specialized cells  rather than the housekeeping functions inferred from earlier promoter studies [ 42-44 ] .,conclusion
Thus  it seems unlikely that the defects in membrane growth and microtubule transport in ago2dop1 embryos are due to a failure in the siRNA pathway .,conclusion

Although future research needs to determine whether in vivo ROR activity is regulated by endogenous ligands  these crystallographic and structural studies do support the concept that ROR activity can be modulated by specific endogenous and/or synthetic ( ant ) agonists [ Kallen et al.  2004 ; Kallen et al.  2002 ; Stehlin-Gaon et al.  2003 ] .,conclusion
Nevertheless  an important conclusion from this framework ( which needs constant repetition ) is that there is not a single ' best ' health system ; rather  there are various options which are more or less consistent with different social goals .,conclusion
Together these results suggest that ethosuximide inhibits chemosensory function to extend C. elegans lifespan .,conclusion
Compared to the ATP and ADP cases  apo Hsp90 is characterized by less ordered ( whether correlated or anti-correlated ) movements  suggesting that the apo Hsp90 may exist in a dynamic conformational equilibrium between multiple states on the energy landscape .,conclusion
Since fibroblasts are most likely key players in radiotherapy related fibrosis  and given the close correlation between PDGF signaling and fibroblasts activity ( e.g. survival and proliferation )  along with results in vivo [ 13 ] we conclude that fibroblasts may as well be a target of RTK inhibitors in the process of attenuating radiation-induced fibrogenesis in vivo .,conclusion
The only possible interpretation for this correlation is that at the Mb scale  rates of recombination are highly conserved between human and chimpanzee .,conclusion

Although the emphasis from the human epidemiology studies has always been on early first pregnancy as a critical determinant for protection  the use of a specific hormone combination for short durations might be applicable to a wider age range than previously thought .,conclusion
Uncalibrated arterial waveform analysis in this setting might even yield worse results .,conclusion
Combined  the results suggest that the phenomenon might pertain to the ADHD-C subtype in particular  although some results indicate that children with less severe ADHD  as those with hyperactive / impulsive subtype  may show weaker forms of the phenomenon .,conclusion

Although these figures should not be extrapolated to estimate mortality of mosquitoes by predacious flies in the field  they do indicate that predacious flies are partly responsible for the high mortality ( over 90 % ) of immature A. gambiae s.l. and play an important role in controlling a population of malaria vectors [ 11  13 ] .,conclusion
Tobin  on the other hand  extrapolates their results inappropriately in my view  and concludes that physicians using physiologic principles will do a better job by themselves than when following protocols [ 2 ] .,conclusion

The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines have shown that the histological evidence of specialized intestinal metaplasia is not necessary for the diagnosis of Barrett 's esophagus  as its absence on one set of biopsies may be solely due to a sampling error  and the tissue may still have an increased neoplastic potential compared with squamous-lined esophagus [ 21 ] .,conclusion
