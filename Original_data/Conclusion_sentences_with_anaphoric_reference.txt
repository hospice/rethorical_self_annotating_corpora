./BMC_Evol_Biol/BMC_Evol_Biol-8-_-2529310.nxml.sentences:212:This conclusion will obviously require the functional characterization of ERs from other protostome phyla in order to carefully check if this observation is general .

./BMC_Bioinformatics/BMC_Bioinformatics-9-Suppl_9-2537561.nxml.sentences-185-To the biologist , however , the variance of a gene with a large FC in one microarray study may be irrelevant if a similar experiment again finds the gene to have a large FC ; the second experiment would probably be considered a validating reproduction .
./BMC_Bioinformatics/BMC_Bioinformatics-9-Suppl_9-2537561.nxml.sentences:186:This conclusion would be reasonable since the gene 's P depends on a poor estimate of variance across few samples , whereas a repeated FC measurement is tangible reproducibility which tends to increase demonstrably with increasing FC .

./PLoS_Genet/PLoS_Genet-4-2-2265475.nxml.sentences:191:This conclusion would be wrong if there was widespread overdominance at the level of individual genes because this would push gene frequencies to intermediate values .
